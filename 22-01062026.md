Here’s what `import socket` is used for in Python, plus a **minimal, safe example**.

## What `import socket` does

`socket` is Python’s standard library module for **network communication**. It lets you create TCP/UDP clients and servers, send and receive bytes, and work with IP addresses and ports.

Common uses:
- TCP/UDP clients and servers
- Local network tools
- Service checks (is a port open?)
- Simple message exchange

---

## Minimal example: TCP client (connect + receive)

```python
import socket

HOST = "example.com"
PORT = 80

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    s.settimeout(5)
    s.connect((HOST, PORT))
    s.sendall(b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n")
    data = s.recv(4096)

print(data.decode(errors="ignore"))
```

---

## Minimal example: TCP server (listen + receive)

```python
import socket

HOST = "0.0.0.0"
PORT = 9000

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    s.bind((HOST, PORT))
    s.listen(1)
    print(f"Listening on {HOST}:{PORT}")

    conn, addr = s.accept()
    with conn:
        print("Connected by", addr)
        data = conn.recv(1024)
        print("Received:", data.decode(errors="ignore"))
        conn.sendall(b"OK\n")
```

---

## Key socket types

```python
socket.AF_INET      # IPv4
socket.AF_INET6     # IPv6
socket.SOCK_STREAM  # TCP
socket.SOCK_DGRAM   # UDP
```

---

## Common methods

- `socket()` – create a socket
- `bind()` – attach to an address (servers)
- `listen()` – wait for connections
- `accept()` – accept a connection
- `connect()` – connect to a server
- `send() / sendall()` – send data
- `recv()` – receive data
- `close()` – close connection

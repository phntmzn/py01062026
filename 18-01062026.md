Below is a **Python rewrite of the globbing concept**, focused on **how wildcard expansion works**, using Python’s standard library.  
This mirrors the Bash examples (`ls -l /etc/p?sswd`, `/e??/passwd`) **without invoking a shell**.

This is **educational**, showing how globbing behaves in programming languages.

## What “globbing” means in Python

In Bash:
- Wildcards are expanded **by the shell** before the command runs.

In Python:
- Wildcards are expanded **by your code**, typically using the `glob` or `pathlib` modules.

Common wildcard characters (same idea as Bash):
- `*` — match any number of characters
- `?` — match exactly one character
- `[abc]` — match one character from a set
- `[!abc]` — negate a set

## Python equivalent of `ls -l /etc/passwd`

```python
from pathlib import Path

path = Path("/etc/passwd")

if path.exists():
    stat = path.stat()
    print(path, stat.st_size, "bytes")
```

---

## Python equivalent of  
`ls -l /etc/p?sswd`

```python
from glob import glob

matches = glob("/etc/p?sswd")

for match in matches:
    print(match)
```

Explanation:
- `p?sswd` matches `passwd`
- `?` expands to `a`
- If only one file matches, it behaves just like the Bash example

---

## Python equivalent of  
`ls -l /e??/passwd`

```python
from glob import glob

matches = glob("/e??/passwd")

for match in matches:
    print(match)
```

Explanation:
- `/e??/` matches directories like `/etc`
- `??` expands to `tc`
- The final resolved path becomes `/etc/passwd`

---

## Using `pathlib` (cleaner, modern Python)

```python
from pathlib import Path

for path in Path("/").glob("e??/passwd"):
    print(path)
```

This does the same thing as `/e??/passwd`.

---

## Demonstrating multiple matches

```python
from glob import glob

for path in glob("/etc/p*"):
    print(path)
```

This is equivalent to:

```bash
ls /etc/p*
```

## Key differences: Bash vs Python globbing

| Feature | Bash | Python |
|------|------|-------|
| Expansion happens | Shell | Your code |
| Pattern syntax | Same | Same |
| Command execution | Yes | No |
| Security boundary | Dangerous if unchecked | Safer if controlled |

Important note:  
Python **does not automatically expand wildcards** in functions like `os.system()` or `subprocess.run()` unless you explicitly enable a shell. You must call globbing functions yourself.

---

## Why this matters (defensive takeaway)

- Globbing can unintentionally expose files if used on untrusted input
- Any program that accepts user-supplied glob patterns should:
  - restrict directories
  - validate patterns
  - avoid running through a shell
- Python makes globbing explicit, which is safer than implicit shell expansion

---

## Summary

- Bash globbing and Python globbing follow the same pattern rules
- Bash expands patterns automatically; Python requires explicit calls
- Python’s `glob` and `pathlib` let you replicate wildcard behavior safely
- Understanding globbing helps prevent accidental file disclosure

If you want next:
- safe pattern validation
- recursive globbing examples
- how globbing interacts with subprocess
- detection of globbing abuse patterns
